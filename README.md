# Python_Countdown
 

Countdown_timer and Pomodoro_Timer codes from https://junilearning.com/blog/coding-projects/make-countdown-timer-python/

Cardio_Timer is the timer for me to understand the countdown code idea.  I’ll try to improvise the code well even I’m thinking try to make GUI with trinket python library.
